In this lab, I learned how Git helps manage changes to my code and track different versions. I practiced creating a repository on GitHub and linking it to my local computer so my work is backed up online. I also learned how to clone a repository, add files, commit changes, and push them to GitHub. Through this process, I understood the difference between Git, which works locally, and GitHub, which stores and shares the code online. Overall, this lab helped me see how version control makes coding more organized and collaborative.

Git is an open-source version control system that lets me track changes in my code and work on different versions of a project. GitHub is an online platform where Git repositories are hosted, allowing developers to collaborate, share code, and manage projects together. I learned that Git works locally to organize my files and track changes, while GitHub provides a place to store and share these projects safely online. In addition, I explored HTML and CSS, which are used to structure and style websites, and learned how SSH can help connect my computer securely to online repositories. Overall, using Git and GitHub helps me organize my work, collaborate with others, and manage projects efficiently while learning essential web development skills.
